* The extension spawn a electron process for read image in clipborad via electron api `clipboard.readImage`.
* extension process communicate with electron process via [node-ipc](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc).
* send the image to [tinyPng](https://tinypng.com/) for size optimization.
* send the image to CDN for hosting

## Installation

## PR welcomed
1. support more platforms
2. support more CDNï¼Œrefer to [current code](https://github.com/njleonzhang/vscode-extension-mardown-image-paste/blob/master/src/CdnUploader/)

## Development
Clone the porject, and open it in vscode. press `F5` to start debug mode after `npm install the dependency`. At last, run `npm run package` to package a extension `vsix` file, and install it to your vscode for test.

## Limitations
1. need to install a extra node module, [electron-image-ipc-server](https://github.com/njleonzhang/electron-image-ipc-server). if we bundle the electron in the extension, the extension size will be more than 70M.
2. the extension starts a long live electron process as a `ipc` server
3. only support mac os currently, should be easy to support other platform, PR welcomed
4. only support [qiniu](https://www.qiniu.com/en) CDN, should be easy support others, such as Amozon S3 and Azure storage, PR welcomed.
5. can not support `gif` due to the [limitation of electron api](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8485)
